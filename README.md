# ML-Logistic_Regression
Logistic Regression:
It is a supervised learning algorithm which divides data into groups or classes, by estimating the probability that an observation matches to a certain class given on its characteristics.
The Dataset is taken from Kaggle -Red Wine Quality.
There are total of 11 Independent Variables namely:
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulphur dioxide
7 - total sulphur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 â€“ alcohol
The Dependent Variable is Quality.
Tasks: 
Develop and evaluate a logistic model to predict the quality (such as high quality and low quality) of red wines according to the several features and calculating test scores. Write your model in Python.

Features that affect wine quality: 'fixed acidity', 'volatile acidity', 'citric acid', 'residual sugar', 'chlorides', 'free sulfur dioxide', 'total sulfur dioxide', 'density', 'pH', 'sulphates', 'alcohol' .

Calculate the accuracy of the prediction.
